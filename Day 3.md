Expression & Arrays 

# Lesson Summary:

in JavaScript, you can declare variables with the var, let, and const keywords.

**Expression vs. statement:**
- An expression asks JS for a value
- A statement tells to do sth (e.g declare/assign a variable)

**Arrays:**
 - arrays let us keep multiple values together in a single collection.
 - arrays can be empty.
 - arrays can hold any type of item, or mix & match.
   
**Some methods used in Arrays:**
 - length: find out the length of an array.
 - includes: returns true if an array contains a specified value.
 - push: to add one or more items to the end of an array.
 - pop: to remove the last item from the array.
 - sort: allows you to sort elements of an array in place.
 - join: creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array, separated by commas or a specified separator string.
 - concat: is used to merge two or more arrays, this method does not change the existing arrays but instead returns a new array.

**mutable vs. immutable**
 - "Mutable" data can be edited (e.g. Arrays), "Immutable" data is always the same (e.g. string & other primitives)
 - if u have the choice, using immutable data & variables is usually best.
